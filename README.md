## Overview
Using a NoSQL database, Vert's Mongoose models synced to its MongoDB database can easily scale exponentially.  Although a green brand new start-up, this social media api can go vertical if it goes viral.

  ## Description
  * Considering the entire planet had a time=out, many of our local and world views have changed. It is time to make new friends, but how, where?
  * Social media apps have been focused upon linking existing family and friends, what about a safe place to practice conversations?
  * Let's face it, some of us are a little rusty and a safe batting cage to pitch a topic and strike up a conversation may help people experiment to gain confidence to apply starting conversations both in the virtual and in the "real" world.
  * The best aspect of the code presented is that it presents thoughts as conversation starters.  When sucessful, there is a continuation of the initial thought and then replies called reactions. When you see a large data set for the topic of conversation presented, it may be a great way to strike up a conversation with a group of people.
  * After all, "It's not easy being green," but it's ok, there may be a million, even a billion or so people who may feel the same way.

  ## Installation
  * As a back end app with a starter front end from a revised UM Miami Bootcamp project Called Pizza-Hunt, please see the video below for a preview of its features before cloning the software:
    1) In your root directory clone the vert repository: git clone git@github.com:ChristiLewis/vert.git ,
    2) Make sure you are in the root directory of vert, the project you just cloned: cd vert 
    3) Then verify your version of node.js: node -v,
    4) Check your version of npm included in node.js: npm -v,
    5) Install the general node package manager or npm: npm i,
    6) Verify your npm packages are installed: ls node_modules,
    7) Add a .gitignore file to spare your GitHub repository uploading all npm modules with each commit: touch .gitignore,
    8) Open the .gitignore file and add on line 1: node_modules,
    9) On line 2 .gitignore file add for mac users: .DS_Store,
    10) On line 3 .gitignore file add the reminder to remove node modules and re-install as needed: NPM i -RUN IN CLI TO BRING BACK NODE MODS.txt
    11) From the command line, run the app: npm start
    12) Open Insomnia and access the back end with http:localhost3001
    13) After you test the app, uninstall the npm packages to not clog your computer: npm uninstall, or simply delete from your folder.
    14) See below for additional notes or alternate installation instructions.

## Usage

Revised Criteria from the Module 18 Challenge:
>WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users, thoughts with authors, continuations of those thoughts, and reactions.
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON,
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to continuations of thoughts.
AS WELL AS add and remove reactions to a continuation of a thought or friends to a user's friend list.
